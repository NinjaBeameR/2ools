# File Converter - Maintenance Mode Implementation

## Date: October 11, 2025

## Issue Summary
The File Converter tool was experiencing critical issues:
1. **Offline Word to PDF conversion** - Failing with canvas rendering errors
2. **Online API conversions** - Timeout and connectivity issues

## Solution Implemented
Temporarily disabled the File Converter tool and implemented a maintenance notice system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Maintenance Notice Component
**File**: `src/components/MaintenanceNotice.jsx`
- Beautiful animated maintenance page
- Shows tool status and what's being fixed
- "Under Maintenance" message with animated wrench icon
- Lists improvements being made:
  - Fixing offline Word to PDF conversion
  - Improving API-based conversions
  - Enhancing stability and performance
  - Better error handling

### 2. Updated Home Page Tool Cards
**File**: `src/pages/Home.jsx`
- Added `maintenance: true` flag to File Converter tool definition
- Updated tool card rendering to show maintenance badge
- Disabled hover effects and clicks for maintenance tools
- Shows amber-colored icon and "Under Maintenance" label

### 3. Updated Tool Window Router
**File**: `src/pages/ToolWindow.jsx`
- Imported MaintenanceNotice component
- Replaced FileConverter component with MaintenanceNotice for 'file-converter' route
- Users now see professional maintenance page instead of broken tool

## Visual Changes

### Tool Card (Home Page)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Amber colored icon (instead of green)
- üîß "Under Maintenance" badge below tool name
- Cursor changes to "not-allowed"
- Card is semi-transparent (60% opacity)
- No hover effects when disabled

### Maintenance Page (When Clicked)
- üîß Large animated wrench icon
- "Under Maintenance" title
- Clear explanation of what's being fixed
- Status indicator showing "Expected to be back soon"
- "Go Back" button to close window

## Root Cause Analysis (For Future Fix)

### Offline Conversion Issues
1. **Canvas rendering in Electron**: html2canvas struggles with off-screen rendering
2. **Timing issues**: Content may not be fully loaded before capture
3. **Font loading**: Fonts might not be ready when canvas is generated

### API Conversion Issues
1. **Timeout settings**: Too short for large files
2. **Network error handling**: Not comprehensive enough
3. **CloudConvert API**: May have rate limiting or connectivity issues

## Code Improvements Made (But Not Activated)
While implementing maintenance mode, several improvements were made to the FileConverter code:

1. **Better timeout handling**: Dynamic timeouts based on file size
2. **Improved error messages**: More specific and helpful error descriptions
3. **Enhanced progress tracking**: Better visual feedback during conversion
4. **Fallback suggestions**: Suggests alternative conversion methods when one fails
5. **API connectivity testing**: Tests connection before attempting conversion
6. **Canvas rendering improvements**: Better visibility and rendering settings

## How to Re-Enable the Tool

### Step 1: Test the Fixes
1. Test offline Word to PDF conversion with various .docx files
2. Test API conversions with internet connection
3. Verify error handling works correctly

### Step 2: Remove Maintenance Flag
In `src/pages/Home.jsx`, line ~27:
```javascript
// Change this:
{ name: 'File Converter', icon: 'FileCode', maintenance: true },

// To this:
{ name: 'File Converter', icon: 'FileCode' },
```

### Step 3: Restore Tool Component
In `src/pages/ToolWindow.jsx`, line ~127:
```javascript
// Change this:
case 'file-converter':
  return <MaintenanceNotice toolName="File Converter" />;

// To this:
case 'file-converter':
  return <FileConverter />;
```

### Step 4: Rebuild and Test
```bash
npm run build
npm run electron
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **User Communication**: Users know the tool is being worked on
2. **Professional**: Better than showing errors or broken functionality
3. **Preserves Code**: All improvements are in place, just disabled
4. **Easy to Re-enable**: Simple flag change when ready
5. **Reusable**: MaintenanceNotice component can be used for other tools

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `src/components/MaintenanceNotice.jsx` (NEW)
2. ‚úÖ `src/pages/Home.jsx` (Modified)
3. ‚úÖ `src/pages/ToolWindow.jsx` (Modified)
4. ‚úÖ `src/tools/FileConverter.jsx` (Improved but disabled)
