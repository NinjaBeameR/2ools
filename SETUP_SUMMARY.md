# âœ… Robust Auto-Update System - COMPLETE

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. **Infinite Checking Loop** âœ…
   - Auto-updater now properly sends error events to UI
   - UI stops showing "checking" when errors occur
   - Silent error handling (no annoying popups)

### 2. **Product Naming** âœ…
   - Changed: `MÃºra-2ools` â†’ `Mura-2ools`
   - Avoids special character issues in filenames
   - Consistent across all files

### 3. **Automated Release System** âœ…
   - GitHub Actions workflow enhanced
   - PowerShell release script created
   - Version management scripts added

## ðŸš€ How to Create a Release (3 Simple Steps):

### **Step 1: Run the Release Script**
```powershell
.\scripts\release.ps1 -BumpType patch
```
*(Use `minor` for features, `major` for breaking changes)*

### **Step 2: Wait for GitHub Actions**
- Visit: https://github.com/NinjaBeameR/2ools/actions
- Wait ~5-10 minutes for build to complete

### **Step 3: Verify Release**
- Visit: https://github.com/NinjaBeameR/2ools/releases
- Your release will be there with installer ready!

## ðŸ“‹ That's It!

The script handles:
- âœ… Version bumping
- âœ… Git commits
- âœ… Tag creation
- âœ… Pushing to GitHub
- âœ… Triggering automated build
- âœ… Publishing release

Users will automatically get update notifications in the app!
